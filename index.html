            <h2>Why Ocho Rios?</h2>
            <h3>Las Choreras, 'The Waterfalls'</h3>
            <p>
              Encompassing the garden parish of St. Ann, the resort area of Ocho
              Rios is the nature lover’s escape. Fabled to be watered by eight
              rivers (as its name suggests) Ocho Rios provides a lush landscape
              of caves, gardens, rivers and white sand beaches. The name Ocho Rios
              actually derives from Las Choreras, meaning "the waterfalls" and may
              be a reflection of the many waterfalls in the area. From the Fern Gully
              located in the remains of an old river bed to the tiered waterfalls of
              Dunn’s River, arguably, Jamaica’s most popular attraction. Ocho Rios
              draws thousands of visitors back to arguably the island’s most romantic,
              picturesque resort area.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ocho Rios Bay Beach is a premier destination renowned for its soft white
              sands and crystal-clear waters.

                            <p>
                                Enjoy a mouth-watering tour around the town of Ocho Rios, sampling local specialties and Jamaican street food. As you walk through the downtown area, your guide will take you off the typical touristy streets and give you insights about the town’s food, architecture and history.

                            <p>
                               In my opinion, you cannot say you have vacationed in Jamaica without sampling some traditional street food.  If you embark on a guided street food tour, you will visit approximately 5 to 7 authentic street vendors and local food shops where you will taste a variety of local foods and delicacies. Finally, you’ll visit a local bar where you can sip on Jamaican rum or sodas.
