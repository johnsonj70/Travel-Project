            <h2>Why Ocho Rios?</h2>
            <h3>Las Choreras, 'The Waterfalls'</h3>
            <p>
              Encompassing the garden parish of St. Ann, the resort area of Ocho
              Rios is the nature lover’s escape. Fabled to be watered by eight
              rivers (as its name suggests) Ocho Rios provides a lush landscape
              of caves, gardens, rivers and white sand beaches. The name Ocho Rios
              actually derives from Las Choreras, meaning "the waterfalls" and may
              be a reflection of the many waterfalls in the area. From the Fern Gully
              located in the remains of an old river bed to the tiered waterfalls of
              Dunn’s River, arguably, Jamaica’s most popular attraction. Ocho Rios
              draws thousands of visitors back to arguably the island’s most romantic,
              picturesque resort area.

              Ocho Rios Bay Beach is a premier destination renowned for its soft white
              sands and crystal-clear waters.

        <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Janice and I love to travel, particularly around
                the caribbean. I love Jamaica and have vacationed there on many
                occasions.  Perhaps by visiting this page you may be inspired to
                vacation in Jamaica yourself.

                    I created this page as part of a project for the SheCodes
                    Responsive Workshop to revisit and enhance the coding skills
                    that I learned at university.
